    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication" target="_blank">domesticated</a> bird, with
      attributes of wild species such as the red and grey junglefowl[1] that are
      originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult
      male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has
      been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a
      sexually immature female is called a pullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
      BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <h3>As know as others names</h3>

    <p>
      An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and
      an adult female is called a 'hen'.[11][12]
    </p>

    <p>Other terms are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>'Biddy:' a newly hatched chicken[13][14]</li>
      <li>'Capon:' a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]</li>
      <li>'Chick:' a young chicken[15]</li>
      <li>'Chook' /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia, informal)[16]</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
      bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus, it has now
      become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
      American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically
      referred to as 'common fowl' or 'domestic fowl'.[22]
    </p>

    <p>
      'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken
      Islands).[23]
